Thanks for the opportunity to complete your challenge! I have completed this using python 3.9.
Once you run the script in the terminal, 
an input box will appear. This will take the form_number you are searching for and this has to be an
exact match. ex(Form W-2) Once you enter in an exact match, the the source URL will dynamically update for the 
requested results and returned as JSON in the terminal. After reviewing the results, simply enter y 
to continue to download any files. The program will promt you for a parameter of years. Start by entering 
the lowest year(enter) then the highest year(enter) you would like to download. After the download is 
complete. Simply re-run the script to explore/download any other files. 



beautifulsoup4 will be required to run this program along with request and lxml.


Exited to hear any feedback!
